This is a simple model for a mood tracker calendar in LaTeX. It implements the calendar by using pgfcalendar and defines new commands to allow for a simple user interface. Colors, legend, and date range are customizable.

I thank [Bet√¢nia C. T. Backes](https://github.com/b-backes) for the suggestion of allowing more than one mood on the same day. Hopefully future versions of this template will allow for more than two.

This template is also available in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/mood-tracker-template/pqsvxnstssmh).
